__Introduction__

---> Water is the most important natural resources in humanâ€™s life. Human needs the water in almost all daily activities such as
washing, cleaning, taking a bath, the irrigation, and the industry needs. 

---> However, the amount of clean water is decreasing,whereas the number of people in the world are always increasing.

--->It can be analyzed that the clean water supply must be improved inorder to fulfill the people need of the clean water regularly.

--->The technology contributes to the culture changes . The technology is commonly made in order to help the people perform
some activities easy. 

--->Consequently, the cultural change is usually triggered by the technological transformation. One of the
present technologies is the automation technology.

--->In some cases, the people sometimes want to carry out their work to be set automatically so that they can save the energy to perform another activity. 

--->Some sophisticated automation materials have been established in order to set some works automatically such as ArduinoTM , which enable to control the electrical circuits logically.
