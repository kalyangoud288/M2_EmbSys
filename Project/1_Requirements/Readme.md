##__Introduction__
1.Water is the most important natural resources in humanâ€™s life. 

2.Human needs the water in almost all daily activities such as washing, cleaning, taking a bath, the irrigation, and the industry needs. 

3.However, the amount of clean water is decreasing.

4.Whereas the number of people in the world are always increasing. The technology contributes to the culture changes. 

5.The technology is commonly made in order to help the people performsome activities easy. 

6.Consequently, the cultural change is usually triggered by the technological transformation.

7.One of the present technologies is the automation technology. In some cases, the people sometimes want to carry out their work to be set automatically so that they can save the energy to perform another activity. 

8.Some sophisticated automation materials have beenestablished in order to set some works automatically such as ArduinoTM microprocessor, which enable to control the electrical
circuits logically. 


__Components Required__

1.Arduino Uno

2.Ultrasonic Sensor

3.Servo Motor

4.LED's(Red,Green)

5.Voltage Display

6.Voltage Supply

7.Ground

8.Potentiometer

__Features__

1. Automatic water pump controller circuit that controls the water pump motor. 

2.The motor gets automatically switched on when water in the overhead tank  falls below the lower limit.

3.Automatic water level controllers switch the motor on whenever the water level drops below a certain level.

4.Shuts the motor off when the water rises well above a fixed level.

5.By using this we can avoid wastage of water and power wastage.
